        <h1>History</h1>
        <img src="history.jpg">
        <p>PreBeans is a coffee shop located in the heart of Thali, Kathmandu. It has been a beloved spot for locals and tourists alike since it first opened its doors in 1995. However, the story of PreBeans actually dates back much further than that.
          In the early 1800s, a young Nepalese farmer named Prema stumbled upon a small patch of wild coffee plants growing in the hills near his village. Intrigued by the unusual plants, he began experimenting with different methods of roasting and brewing the beans. Over time, Prema's coffee became famous among his friends and neighbors for its rich, bold flavor.
             As word of his delicious coffee spread, Prema decided to open a small coffee shop in Thali, the bustling capital city of Nepal. He named the shop "PreBeans" in honor of the beans that had inspired him. The shop quickly became a popular gathering place for locals, who would come to enjoy a hot cup of coffee and catch up on the latest news and gossip.
            Over the years, PreBeans grew in size and popularity. It became known for its cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and of course, its delicious coffee. Today, it is one of the most beloved coffee shops in Kathmandu, attracting visitors from all over the world.
            Despite its success, PreBeans has never forgotten its humble roots. The shop still roasts its coffee in small batches, using the same techniques that Prema developed over two centuries ago. And while the coffee may have become more famous, the shop's warm and welcoming spirit has remained the same.</p>
